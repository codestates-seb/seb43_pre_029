          "value": "The solution here lies in defining a new draw key. However, as Tjebo points out in the comments, it is difficult to customize the slopes this way because the data passed to the draw_key_* functions does not contain all the aesthetic data - only that necessary to make the standard draw keys (linewidth, colour, fill, etc). One way round this is to take advantage of the fact that ggplots are built using the ggproto system, which itself is based on nested environments. A custom draw_key_* function can be written that looks up the appropriate ancestor frame to find the whole aesthetic data set",
